## Proposal
### Motivation

Feedback from Sean MacAvaney highlighted that the existing PyTerrier documentation is not user-friendly, leading to difficulties for individuals trying to use the document. This critical issue is discouraging users and creating barriers to effective use of PyTerrier. In response to this, this project has been initiated.



### Aims

The objective of this project is to enhance the existing PyTerrier documentation by introducing interactive elements and implementing a comprehensive redesign. These improvements aim to simplify the understanding of each model, enhance user engagement, and bolster the overall attractiveness of the documentation.

#### Evaluation Metrics
The success of the revamped documentation will be evaluated through user interview scores. These scores will serve as a reliable metric to assess the effectiveness and appeal of the updated documentation. It is anticipated that the enhancements will result in higher scores compared to the current version, indicating a more user-friendly and engaging documentation experience.




## Progress
#### Week 1
- Receiving the project expectation and requirements.
- Had a kickoff meeting to gather basic requirements and resources.
- Interviewed 2 participants for design review.

#### Week 2
- Wrote an invite interviewees.
- Start designing the documentation page using Figma.
- Preparing form to accomodate interviewee lack of time and gain wider feedback on the website.
- Resovle last week risk by doing more research about Vercel.


## Problems and risks
### Problems

- Does not able to do interview in time due to time constraint from the interviewee 
- Many tasks was delayed due to multiple design editing
- Incomplete understanding of the library
- Bad time management


### Risks
- Might not be able to finish in time.
- It is mentioned by supervisor that the previous plan is too optimistic and after a good consideration the plan should be changed to be more realistic by add more weeks for development process.



## Plan
### Current Week
This weekâ€™s main goal is to continue on implementing the design.
### Far Future
- Week 1 - Gather requirments & Set up
