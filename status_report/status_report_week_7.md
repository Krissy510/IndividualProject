## Interactive Documentation for PyTerrier
#### Raviphas Sananpanichkul

## Proposal
### Motivation

Feedback from Sean MacAvaney highlighted that the existing PyTerrier documentation is not user-friendly, leading to difficulties for individuals trying to use the document. This critical issue is discouraging users and creating barriers to effective use of PyTerrier. In response to this, this project has been initiated.



### Aims

The objective of this project is to enhance the existing PyTerrier documentation by introducing interactive elements and implementing a comprehensive redesign. These improvements aim to simplify the understanding of each model, enhance user engagement, and bolster the overall attractiveness of the documentation.

#### Evaluation Metrics
The success of the revamped documentation will be evaluated through user interview scores. These scores will serve as a reliable metric to assess the effectiveness and appeal of the updated documentation. It is anticipated that the enhancements will result in higher scores compared to the current version, indicating a more user-friendly and engaging documentation experience.




## Progress
#### Week 1
- Receiving the project expectation and requirements.
- Had a kickoff meeting to gather basic requirements and resources.
- Interviewed 2 participants for design review.

#### Week 2
- Wrote an invite interviewees.
- Start designing the documentation page using Figma.
- Preparing form to accomodate interviewee lack of time and gain wider feedback on the website.
- Resovle last week risk by doing more research about Vercel.

#### Week 3
- Start implementing the design
- Studying a library for the project
- Interview 2 interviewees

#### Week 4

## Problems and risks
### Problems
- I haven’t received any update on the example on ”Working with document”.


### Risks
- By using other library such as Docusaurus,were lied heavily that this library will continue developing and not deprecated.
- With the progress on the back-end I believe that the current plan will not be able to be completed. Therefore, the plan needs to be re-evaluate.


## Plan
### Current Week
This week main purpose is to continue developed the backend side and also start implement frontend of the
interactive feature.

### Far Future
