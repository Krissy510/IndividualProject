## Interactive Documentation for PyTerrier
#### Raviphas Sananpanichkul

## Proposal
### Motivation

Feedback from Sean MacAvaney highlighted that the existing PyTerrier documentation is not user-friendly, leading to difficulties for individuals trying to use the document. This critical issue is discouraging users and creating barriers to effective use of PyTerrier. In response to this, this project has been initiated.



### Aims

The objective of this project is to enhance the existing PyTerrier documentation by introducing interactive elements and implementing a comprehensive redesign. These improvements aim to simplify the understanding of each model, enhance user engagement, and bolster the overall attractiveness of the documentation.

#### Evaluation Metrics
The success of the revamped documentation will be evaluated through user interview scores. These scores will serve as a reliable metric to assess the effectiveness and appeal of the updated documentation. It is anticipated that the enhancements will result in higher scores compared to the current version, indicating a more user-friendly and engaging documentation experience.




## Progress
#### Week 1
- Receiving the project expectation and requirements.
- Had a kickoff meeting to gather basic requirements and resources.
- Interviewed 2 participants for design review.

#### Week 2
- Wrote an invite interviewees.
- Start designing the documentation page using Figma.
- Preparing form to accomodate interviewee lack of time and gain wider feedback on the website.
- Resovle last week risk by doing more research about Vercel.

#### Week 3
- Start implementing the design
- Studying a library for the project
- Interview 2 interviewees

#### Week 4
- Implemented the base design 
- Hosted the website
- Write up the ”Getting Start” section 
- Trying out PyTerrier


## Problems and risks
### Problems
- The main problem right now, is I am not sure which feature to focus on. The main problem is that the documentation is not well written. To solve this issue, we should improve the documentation by improving the design, examples, and explanations, and adding interactive examples. Because the most effective way to solve the main issue is to improve other aspects of the documentation instead of the interactivity of the documentation. Since many comments I got from the interview are targeted at the content of the documentation rather than the interactive feature. However, the project description is more towards the interactive feature. That is why I’m not sure which feature to prioritize first.


### Risks
- By using other library such as Docusaurus, we relied heavily that this library will continue developing and not deprecated.


## Plan
### Current Week
This week’s main goal is to continue on implementing the design.
### Far Future
- Week 1 - Gather requirments & Set up
- Week 2 - Complete base design & Gain more metrics via user feedback
- Week 3 - Start implement the design & Edit the design according to feedback & Gain more metrics via user feedback
- Week 4 - Continue implement the design
- Week 5 - Add more pages & Design the interactive feature
- Week 6 - If design pass then start implement the front end of the interactive feature
- Week 7 - Continue development
- Week 8 - Start implement backend of the project
- Week 9 - Continue development
- Week 10 - Integrate & Testing
- Week 11 - Evaluate new documentation with interactive design & Clean up bugs
