## Proposal
### Motivation

Feedback from Sean MacAvaney highlighted that the existing PyTerrier documentation is not user-friendly, leading to difficulties for individuals trying to use the document. This critical issue is discouraging users and creating barriers to effective use of PyTerrier. In response to this, this project has been initiated.



### Aims

The objective of this project is to enhance the existing PyTerrier documentation by introducing interactive elements and implementing a comprehensive redesign. These improvements aim to simplify the understanding of each model, enhance user engagement, and bolster the overall attractiveness of the documentation.

#### Evaluation Metrics
The success of the revamped documentation will be evaluated through user interview scores. These scores will serve as a reliable metric to assess the effectiveness and appeal of the updated documentation. It is anticipated that the enhancements will result in higher scores compared to the current version, indicating a more user-friendly and engaging documentation experience.




## Progress
#### Week 1
- Receiving the project expectation and requirements.
- Had a kickoff meeting to gather basic requirements and resources.
- Interviewed 2 participants for design review.


## Problems and risks
### Problems
- Insufficient diversity in user interview participants.
- Incomplete understanding of the library’s functionality.


### Risks
- Deployment might become a problem later as the project is divided into frontend and backend. Currently, it is decided that Vercel will be used to host frontend while University’s cluster will be used to host the backend side.


## Plan
### Current Week
This week’s main goal is to complete the user interview for the current design and to start designing how
the new documentation webpage will look like.
### Far Future
- Week 1 - Gather requirments & Set up
- Week 2 - Research & Complete design of improved documentation without interactive documentation
- Week 3 - Complete design
- Week 4 - Continue complete design & Clean up
- Week 5 - Evaluate the new documentation and design the interactive feature
- Week 6 - Complete Frontend Interactive feature
- Week 7 - Complete Backend for interactive feature
- Week 8 - Integration & Testing
- Week 9 - Evaluate new documentation & Clean up
