## Screening Questions
1. Are you familiar with Information Retrieval (IR)?

   1.1 If yes, which libraries or tools have you used in the past?

2. Have you ever encountered or used PyTerrier or Terrier?

   2.1 If yes, have you consulted their documentation?

3. Do you have experience using technical documentation?

   3.1 If no, then I explain what is technical documentation and its usage.

### Rationale Behind the Questions:
**First Question:** The aim of this question is to gauge the participant's prior knowledge of Information Retrieval (IR). Participants familiar with IR concepts like indexing, retrieval, and evaluation may find it easier to navigate tasks related to IR.

**Second Question:** This question assesses the participant's familiarity with PyTerrier. Those who have prior experience with PyTerrier are likely to have an easier time finding relevant information compared to those who are new to it.

**Third Question:** This query evaluates the participant's comfort level with technical documentation. Those who have frequently used documentation may have an advantage in efficiently locating information.

## Task 0: Set up

Could you please open the link I've sent you?

**Goal**: This preliminary task ensures that the participant can access the PyTerrier documentation where the following tasks will take place.

## Intro to task

In the upcoming section, I will pose a question to you. Your task will be to navigate through the provided documentation to find an answer. If you're unable to locate the information within 5 to 10 minutes, you have two options:

1. Inform me that you'd like to give up on that particular task.
2. Allow me to conclude the task if the time exceeds the 5-10 minute window.

## After finished or give up

After each task, I'll ask you to rate your experience on a scale from 0 to 10. A rating of 10 implies that the design significantly facilitated the task to the extent that you could complete it in just a few steps, while a 0 indicates that the design hindered task completion.

Additionally, I'll ask you what could be improved in the documentation to make it more user-friendly.

### Task 1: What is PyTerrier?

### Task 2: How to install PyTerrier?

If found, does the installation is understanable for you?

### Task 3: How to get start with PyTerrier?

## Overall
