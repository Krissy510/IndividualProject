To evaluate the effectiveness of the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of PyTerrier's documentation web pages.

## Introduction Script

Welcome and thank you for participating in this research study. 
Our goal today is to assess the UI/UX of PyTerrier's documentation web pages. 
Your feedback will provide insights that can help us measure the effectiveness of the current design and serve as a basis for future improvements.

As of now, we have no written user feedback, that is why your feedbacks is very essential.
Here's what we'll be doing:
1. First, I'll ask you to navigate to PyTerrier's documentation web page.
   
2. Then, you'll receive a task to complete while on the site.

For the purpose of this study, I'll be recording this session and also collect feedback from you regarding the design, as well as some basic information.

Feel free to let me know if you need a break or wish to discontinue the task.

This is not a test of your abilities; As I am purely interested in gathering feedback.

You have the option to withdraw from the interview at any time; simply let me know if you wish to do so.

With all that said, do you consent to participating in this interview?

Is there anything you'd like to ask before we begin?
